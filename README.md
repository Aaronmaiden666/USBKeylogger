# About
The USB WiFi Keylogger is a hardware hacking tool which is capable of sniffing key presses sent from a USB keyboard to a computer and presenting them to the attacker over WiFi. The keylogger runs a modified version of [@spacehuhn's wifi keylogger code](https://github.com/spacehuhn/wifi_keylogger) with a few more tricks and features.
